## Free Wave Samples

```
All of the samples posted on this site have been recorded by Jason Champion in his home studio and are distributed as freeware and may be used royalty-free. If you use any of the samples from this site in your music, film, or other creative work we would appreciate it if you linked to us from your website or mentioned us in your creative work's accompanying literature. This is not required, but it is good karma.

You may not place copies of samples available on this site on your own website for download. Although they are offered for free, they are meant to be downloaded from the original source. However, if you are using some of our samples as sound effects for a web application (game, virtual drum machine, etc.) you can and should host them on your own site. We don't prevent direct linking to files, but may do so in the future if bandwidth costs become a problem.

### 1.7.0 29 Oct 2013

[Release announcement](http://markheath.net/post/naudio-17-release-notes)
* MediaFoundationReader allows you to play any audio files that Media Foundation can play, which on Windows 7 and above means playback of AAC, MP3, WMA, as well as playing the audio from video files.
* MediaFoundationEncoder allows you to easily encode audio using any Media Foundation Encoders installed on your machine. The WPF Demo application shows this in action, allowing you to encode AAC, MP3 and WMA files in Windows 8.
* MediaFoundationTransform is a low-level class designed to be inherited from, allowing you to get direct access to Media Foundation Transforms if that’s what you need.
* MediaFoundationResampler direct access to the Media Foundation Resampler MFT as an IWaveProvider, with the capability to set the quality level.
* NAudio is now built against .NET 3.5. This allows us to make use of language features such as extension methods, LINQ and Action/Func parameters.
* You can enumerate Media Foundation Transforms to see what’s installed. The WPF Demo Application shows how to do this.
* WasapiCapture supports exclusive mode, and a new WASAPI capture demo has been added to the WPF demo application, allowing you to experiment more easily to see what capture formats your soundcard will support.
* A new ToSampleProvider extension method on IWaveProvider now makes it trivially easy to to convert any PCM WaveProvider to an ISampleProvider. There is also another extension method allowing an ISampleProvider to be passed directly into any IWavePlayer implementation without the need for converting back to an IWaveProvider first.
* WaveFileWriter supports creating a 16 bit WAV file directly from an ISampleProvider with the new CreateWaveFile16static method.
* IWavePosition interface implemented by several IWavePlayer classes allows greater accuracy of determining exact position of playback. Contribution courtesy of ioctlLR
* AIFF File Writer (courtesy of Gaiwa)
* Added the ability to add a local ACM driver allowing you to use ACM codecs without installing them. Use AcmDriver.AddLocalDriver
* ReadFullyproperty allows you to create never-ending MixingSampleProvider, for use when dynamically adding and removing inputs.
* WasapiOut now allows setting the playback volume directly on the MMDevice.
* Support for sending MIDI Sysex messages, thanks to Marcel Schot
* A new BiQuadFilterfor easy creation of various filter types including high pass, low pass etc
* A new EnvelopeGeneratorclass for creating ADSR envelopes based on a blog post from Nigel Redmon.
* Lots of bugfixes (see the commit history for more details). Some highlights include…
  * Fixed a long-standing issue with MP3FileReader incorrectly interpreting some metadata as an MP3 frame then throwing an exception saying the sample rate has changed.
  * WaveFileReader.TryReadFloat works in stereo files
  * Fixed possible memory exception with large buffer sizes for WaveInBuffer and WaveOutBuffer
* Various code cleanups including removal of use of ApplicationException, and removal of all classes marked as obsolete.
* Preview Release of WinRT support.The NAudio nuget package now includes a WinRT version of NAudio for Windows 8 store apps. This currently supports basic recording and playback. This should still very much be thought of as a preview release. There are still several parts of NAudio (in particular several of the file readers and writers) that are not accessible, and we may need to replace the MFT Resampler used by WASAPI with a fully managed one, as it might mean that Windows Store certification testing fails.
  * Use WasapiOutRT for playback
  * Use WasapiCaptureRTfor record (thanks to Kassoul for some performance enhancement suggestions)
  * There is a demo application in the NAudio source code showing record and playback

### 1.6.0 26 Oct 2012

[Release Announcement](http://markheath.net/post/naudio-16-release-notes-10th)

* WASAPI Loopback Capture allowing you to record what your soundcard is playing (only works on Vista and above)
* ASIO Recording ASIO doesn’t quite fit with the IWaveIn model used elsewhere in NAudio, so this is implemented in its own special way, with direct access to buffers or easy access to converted samples for most common ASIO configurations. Read more about it here.
* MultiplexingWaveProvider and MultiplexingSampleProvider allowing easier handling of multi-channel audio. Read more about it here.
* FadeInOutSampleProvider simplifying the process of fading audio in and out
* WaveInEvent for more reliable recording on a background thread
* PlaybackStopped and RecordingStoppedevents now include an exception. This is very useful for cases when USB audio devices are removed during playback or record. Now there is no unhandled exception and you can detect this has happened by looking at the EventArgs. (n.b. I’m not sure if adding a property to an EventArgs is a breaking change – recompile your code against NAudio 1.6 to be safe).
* MixingWaveProvider32 for cases when you don’t need the overhead of WaveMixerStream. MixingSampleProvider should be preferred going forwards though.
* OffsetSampleProvider allows you to delay a stream, skip over part of it, truncate it, and append silence. Read about it here.
* Added a Readme file to recognise contributors to the project. I’ve tried to include everyone, but probably many are missing, so get in touch if you’re name’s not on the list.
* Some code tidyup(deleting old classes, some namespace changes. n.b. these are breaking changes if you used these parts of the library, but most users will not notice). This includes retiring WaveOutThreadSafe which was never finished anyway, and WaveOutEvent is preferred to using WaveOut with function callbacks in any case.
* NuGet package and CodePlex download now use the release build (No more Debug.Asserts if you forget to dispose stuff)
* Lots of bugfixes, including a concerted effort to close off as many issues in the CodePlex issue tracker as possible.
* Fix to GSM encoding
* ID3v2 Tag Creation
* ASIO multi-channel playback improvements
* MP3 decoder now flushes on reposition, fixing a potential issue with leftover sound playing when you stop, reposition and then play again.
* MP3FileReader allows pluggable frame decoders, allowing you to choose the DMO one, or use a fully managed decoder (hopefully more news on this in the near future)
* WMA Nuget Package (NAudio.Wma) for playing WMA files. Download here.
* RF64 read support

### 1.5.0 18 Dec 2011

[Release Announcement](http://markheath.net/post/naudio-15-released)

* Now available on NuGet!
* Numerous bugfixes mean we are now working fully in x64 as well as x86, so NAudio.dll is now marked as AnyCPU. (You can still force x86 by marking your own executable as x86 only.)
* WaveOutEvent – a new WaveOut mode with event callback, highly recommended instead of WaveOut with function callbacks
* 24 bit ASIO driver mode (LSB)
* Float LSB ASIO driver mode
* WaveFileWriter has had a general code review and API cleanup
* Preview of new ISampleProvider interface making it much easier to write custom 32 bit IEEE (float) audio pipeline components, without the need to convert to byte[]. Lots of examples in NAudioDemo of using this and more documentation will follow in future.
* Several ISampleProvider implementations to get you started. Expect plenty more in future NAudio versions:
  * PanningSampleProvider
  * MixingSampleProvider
  * MeteringSampleProvider
  * MonoToStereoSampleProvider
  * NotifyingSampleProvider
  * Pcm16BitToSampleProvider
  * Pcm8BitToSampleProvider
  * Pcm24BitToSampleProvider
  * SampleChannel
  * SampleToWaveProvider
  * VolumeSampleProvider
  * WaveToSampleProvider
* Added AiffFileReader courtesy of Giawa
* AudioFileReader to simplify opening any supported file, easy volume control, read/reposition locking
* BufferedWaveProvider uses CircularBuffer instead of queue (less memory allocations)
* CircularBuffer is now thread-safe
* MP3Frame code cleanup
* MP3FileReader throws less exceptions
* ASIOOut bugfixes for direct 16 bit playback
* Some Demos added to NAudioDemo to give simple examples of how to use the library
  * NAudioDemo has an ASIO Direct out form, mainly for testing the AsioOut class at different bit depths (still recommended to convert to float before you get there).
  * NAudioDemo has simple MP3 streaming form (play MP3s while they download)
  * NAudioDemo has simple network streaming chat application
  * NAudioDemo playback form uses MEF to make it much more modular and extensible (new output drivers, new file formats etc)
  * NAudioDemo can play aiff
* GSM 6.10 ACM codec support
* DSP Group TrueSpeech ACM codec support
* Fully managed G.711 a-law and mu-law codecs (encode & decode)
* Fully managed G.722 codec (encode & decode)
* Example of integration with NSpeex
* Fix to PlaybackStopped using SyncContext for thread safety
* Obsoleted IWavePlayer.Volume (can still set volume on WaveOut directly if you want)
* Improved FFT display in WPF demo
* WaveFileReader - tolerate junk after data chunk
* WaveOut constructor detects if no sync context & choose func callbacks
* WaveOut function mode callbacks hopefully chased out the last of the hanging bugs (if in a WaveOutWrite at same time as WaveOutReset, bad things happen - so need locks, but if WaveOutReset called during a previous func callback that is about to call waveOutWrite we deadlock)
* Now has an msbuild script allowing me to more easily create releases, run tests etc
* Now using Mercurial for source control, hopefully making bug fixing old releases and accepting user patches easier. n.b. this unfortunately means all old submitted patches are no longer available for download on the CodePlex page.
* WPF Demo enhancements:
  * WPF Demo is now .NET 4, allowing us to use MEF, and will be updated hopefully with more examples of using NAudio.
  * WPF Demo uses windowing before FFT for a more accurate spectrum plot
  * WPF Demo has visualization plugins, allowing me to trial different drawing mechanisms
  * WPF Demo has a (very basic) drum machine example

### 1.4.0 20 Apr 2011

[Release announcement](http://markheath.net/post/naudio-14-release-notes)

* Major interop improvements to support native x64. Please note that I have not in this release changed the dll’s target platform away from x86 only as I don’t personally have an x64 machine to test on. However, we are now in a state where around 95% of the interop should work fine in x64 mode so feel free to recompile for “any CPU”. You should also note that if you do run in native x64 mode, then you probably will find there are no ACM codecs available, so WaveFormatConversionStream might stop working – another reason to stay targetting x86 for now.
* There have also been major enhancements to MP3 File Reader, which is the main reason for pushing this new release out. Please read this post for more details as this is a breaking change – you no longer need to use a WaveFormatConversionStream or a BlockAlignReductionStream.
* More examples IWaveProvider implementers have been added, including the particularly useful BufferedWaveProvider which allows you to queue up buffers to be played on demand.
  * BufferedWaveProvider
  * Wave16toFloatProvider
  * WaveFloatTo16Provider
  * WaveInProvider
  * MonoToStereoProvider16
  * StereoToMonoProvider16
  * WaveRecorder
* The NAudioDemo project has been updated to attempt to show best practices (or at least good practices) of how you should be using these classes.
* The NAudioDemo project also now demonstrates how to select the output device for WaveOut, DirectSoundOut, WasapiOut and AsioOut.
* WaveChannel32 can now take inputs of more bit depths – 8, 16, 24 and IEEE float supported. NAudioDemo shows how to play back these files.
* A general spring clean removed a bunch of obsolete classes from the library.
* AsioOut more reliable, although I still think there are more issues to be teased out. Please report whether it works on your hardware.
* WaveFileReader and WaveFileWriter support for 24 and 32 bit samples
* Allow arbitrary chunks to appear before fmt chunk in a WAV file
* Reading and writing WAV files with Cues
* Obsoleted some old WaveFileWriter and WaveFileReader methods
* Fixed a longstanding issue with WaveOutReset hanging in function callbacks on certain chipsets
* Added sequencer specific MIDI event
* RawWaveSourceStream turns a raw audio data stream into a WaveStream with specified WaveFormat
* A DMO MP3 Frame Decoder as an alternative to the ACM one
* Easier selection of DirectSound output device
* WaveOut uses 2 buffers not 3 by default now (a leftover from the original days of NAudio when my PC had a 400MHz Pentium II processor!).
* Lots more minor bug fixes & patches applied – see the check-in history for full details

### 1.3.0 10 Oct 2009

[Release Announcement](http://markheath.net/post/naudio-13-release-notes)

* WaveOut has a new constructor (this is breaking change), which allows three options for waveOut callbacks. This is because there is no “one size fits all” solution, but if you are creating WaveOut on the GUI thread of a Winforms or WPF application, then the default constructor should work just fine. WaveOut also allows better flexibility over controlling the number of buffers and desired latency.
* Mp3FileReader and WaveFileReadercan have a stream as input, and WaveFileWritercan write to a stream. These features are useful to those wanting to stream data over networks.
* The new IWaveProvider interface is like a lightweight WaveStream. It doesn’t support repositioning or length and current position reporting, making the implementation of synthesizers much simpler. The IWavePlayer interface takes an IWaveProvider rather than WaveStream. WaveStream implements IWaveProvider, so existing code continues to work just fine.
* Added in LoopStream, WaveProvider32 and WaveProvider16 helper classes. Expect more to be built upon these in the future.
* I have also started using the WaveBuffer class. This clever idea from Alexandre Mutel allows us to trick the .NET type system into letting us cast from byte[] to float[] or short[]. This improves performance by eliminating unnecessary copying and converting of data.
* There have been many bugfixes including better support for VBR MP3 file playback.
* The mixer API has had a lot of bugs fixed and improvements, though differences between Vista and XP continue to prove frustrating.
* The demo project (NAudioDemo) has been improved and includes audio wave-form drawing sample code.
* There is now a WPF demo as well (NAudioWpfDemo), which also shows how to draw wave-forms in WPF, and even includes some preliminary FFT drawing code.
* The WaveIn support has been updated and enhanced. WaveInStream is now obsolete.
* WASAPI audio capture is now supported.
* NAudio should now work correctly on x64operating systems (accomplished this by setting Visual Studio to compile for x86).

### 1.2.0 26 Jun 2008

[Release Announcement](http://markheath.net/post/naudio-12-release-notes)

* WASAPI Output Model. We are now able to play audio using the new WASAPI output APIs in Windows Vista. We support shared mode and exclusive mode, and you can optionally use event callbacks for the buffer population. You may need to experiment to see what settings work best with your soundcard.
* ASIO Output Model. We can also play back audio using any ASIO output drivers on your system. It is not working yet with all soundcards, but its working great with the ever-popular ASIO4All.
* New DirectSound Output Model. We have moved away from using the old managed DirectX code for DirectSound output, and done the interop ourselves. This gives us a much more reliable way to use DirectSound.
* IWavePlayer simplifications. As part of our ongoing plans to improve the NAudio architecture, the IWavePlayer interface has gone on a diet and lost some unnecessary methods.
* ResamplerDMO stream. Some Windows Vista systems have a Resampler DirectX Media Object that can be used to convert PCM and IEEE audio samples between different sample rates and bit depths. We have provided a managed wrapper around this, and it is used internally by the WASAPI output stream to do sample rate conversion if required.
* ACM Enhancements - There have been a number of bugfixes and enhancements to the support for using the ACM codecs in your system.
* BlockAlignmentReductionStream - This WaveStream helps to alleviate the problem of dealing with compressed audio streams whose block alignment means that you can't position exactly where you want or read the amount you want. BlockAlignmentReductionStream uses buffering and read-ahead to allow readers full flexibility over positioning and read size.
* MP3 Playback - The MP3 File Reader Stream is now able to work with any wave output thanks to the BlockAlignmentReductionStream and playback MP3 files without stuttering. It uses any MP3 ACM decoder it can find on your system.
* Custom WaveFormat Marshaler - The WaveFormat structure presents an awkward problem for interop with unmanaged code. A custom marshaler has been created which will be extended in future versions to allow WaveFormat structures to present their extra data.
* NAudioDemo- One of the problems with NAudio has been that there are very few examples of how to use it. NAudioDemo has four mini-examples of using NAudio:
  * receiving MIDI input
  * playing WAV or MP3 files through any output
  * examining ACM codecs and converting files using them
  * recording audio using WaveIn
  * In addition the AudioFileInspector, MixDiff, MIDI File Splitter and MIDI File Mapper projects demonstrate other aspects of the NAudio framework.
* Unit Tests - NAudio now has a small collection of unit tests, which we intend to grow in future versions. This will help us to ensure that as the feature set grows, we don't inadvertently break old code.
* IWaveProvider Tech Preview - As discussed recently on my blog, we will be using a new interface called IWaveProvider in future versions of NAudio, which uses the WaveBuffer class. This code is available in the version 1.2 release, but you are not currently required to use it.
* Alexandre Mutel- Finally, this version welcomes a new contributor to the team. In fact, Alexandre is the first contributor I have added to this project. He has provided the new implementations of ASIO and DirectSoundOut, as well as helping out with WASAPI and the new IWaveProvider interface design. His enthusiasm for the project has also meant that I have been working on it a little more than I might have otherwise!
